This program provides an opportunity to find unique words in a file, translate them and launch a widget for sequential study of these words. All this will allow you to read a book / article / document in the original language and also learn unfamiliar words. During the study, the experience is saved, which will allow you not to waste time on already studied words. You can select already prepared sets of words in the catalog.
